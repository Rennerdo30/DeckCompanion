# DeckCompanion
App to simplify installation of fixes for non working games on the steam deck

General Idea
---
This tool should be selected as a Steam Play compatibility tool. 
DeckCompanion will then internally select a working proton version and will apply fixes to the wine prefix, if needed.


Installation
---
Open `Konsole` and enter the following command:
```bash
cd /home/deck/.local/share/Steam/compatibilitytools.d/ && git clone https://github.com/Rennerdo30/DeckCompanion.git
```
Then restart Steam
